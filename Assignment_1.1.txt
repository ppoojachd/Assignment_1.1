Say True or False for the below statements:
• Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes?
Ans: False, Prescriptive is used to prescribe solutions to improve the outcomes. Predictive is the correct one.
• Base R packages installed automatically?
Ans: True
2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
Ans: If two vectors are of unequal length, the shorter one will be recycled(repeated) in order to match the longer vector. 
3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
Ans: e.g. 
the following vector short_vec and long_vec have different lengths, and their sum is computed by recycling values of the shorter vector .
One point to remember here, longer object should be multiple of shorter object.
short_vec<- c(1,5,10)
long_vec<-c(10,15,30,40,50,60)
#then 
print(short_vec + long_vec)

outcome would be
11 20 40 41 55 70
